# Common Arithmetic Operators
# +, -, *, /
'''example'''
print(7*3)
print(10/2)
print(1+1)
# notice how when dividing, you get a float numeric type
# the outcome of the function will adopt the more compelex numeric type
'''example'''
print(10.0+1)
# other Arithmetic Operators
# //, **, %
# the // divides and rounds down to nearest integer
print(11//2)
# the ** is for exponentials
print(2**3)
# the % gives you the remainder of numbers divided
# useful to figure out if something is odd or even
print(11%2) #2 goes into 11 5 times with a remainder of 1
# the == checks if a statement is true or false
print(11%2 == 1) #does the remainder of 11/2 equal 1? true
