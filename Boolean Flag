'''Boolean Flags'''

# boolean can be used to indicate when to exit an iteration. We use a boolean "flag" to dictate when the code needs to stop running


lst = [23, 42, 86, 92, 93, 94]

has_value_over_90 = False
for val in lst:
    if val > 90:
        has_value_over_90 = True
        break
# this code runs through the list and determines if the list contains a value greater than 90. If not, the code defaults to False
# we use a boolean flag to stop looping through the code once the answer has been determined
print(has_value_over_90)
print( )

# can also be useful in stopping loops that would otherwise continue for infinity
done = False

while not done:
