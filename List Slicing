'''List Slicing'''

# Slicing Format --> [ <start> : <stop> : <increment> ]

a = 1
n = 20

num_list = list(range(a, n))

print(num_list[0:5])
print(num_list[10:]) #implied that the last value is the stop value n; all values to the end of list
print(num_list[7:14])
print( )

# Note that element at index -1 is not shown when slicing num_list
# up until that index
print(num_list[-1])
print(num_list[-7:-1])
print( )

my_list = list(range(10, 20))
# Get all the elements at index 5 to the end of the list
print(my_list[5:])

# This works with negative indexing as well, the statement below returns a list
# with the final five elements from the original list
print(my_list[-5:])
print( )

'''Creating a Sublist'''

# Creating a sublist is simply assigning a variable to a slice so that when the variable is called, the slice is brought forward

list_1=list(range(1,10))
print('Original list: ', list_1)
print('Slice: ', list_1[2:7])
Sublist = list_1[2:7] #this is the new sublist which was sliced from the original list
print('Sublist: ', list_1[2:7])
print( )

'''Using Increments'''

students = ['Avery', 24, 'Finance', 'Carol', 26, 'Linguistics', 'Vinny', 24, 'Economics']
# We can use increments to pick out certain pieces of a list
names = students[::3]
print('Names: ', names)
age = students[1::3]
print('Age: ', age)
major = students[2::3]
print('Major: ', major)

# Remember, the format of list referncing is
  # [<start> : <stop> : <increment>]
