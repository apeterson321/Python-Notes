'''Accessing List Values'''

some_list = list(range(1,11))
print(some_list)

# Zero based indexing --> the first element in a list is at index 0, the second element is at index 1, the third at index 2, etc.
some_list[0] #to access the first element in the list.
some_list[1] #to access the second element in the list.
some_list[2] #to access the third element in the list.
 
print(some_list[0])
print(some_list[5])
print(some_list[9])
print( )

# You can also index some list using negative numbers to find values from back of the list
some_list[-1] #to access the last value of a list.
some_list[-2] #to access the second to last value of a list.
print(some_list)
print(some_list[-1])
print(some_list[-2])
print( )

'''Modifying Some List'''

# a list typed object is mutable. This means that the objects within a list can be modified, rearranged, or even deleted
other_list = [1,2,3,4,5]

other_list[0] = 'dolphin' #this changes the first value 0 to the string 'dolphin'

print(other_list)

other_list[-1] = 'pussy lips'

print(other_list)
print( )

# You can also use the del bulitin to delete a value in a list
my_list = list(range(1,6))
print(my_list)

del my_list[2] #this will delete the third value 3 from the list

print(my_list)
print( )


'''List Unpacking '''

# A list with three cat breeds
cat_list = ['bengal', 'siamese', 'sphinx']

# Unpacking the list into three new variables (cat1, cat2 and cat3),
# which is equal to the number of elements within cat_list
cat1, cat2, cat3 = cat_list

# can also be written as
cat1, cat2, cat3 = cat_list[0], cat_list[1], cat_list[2]

print(f'{cat1} {cat2} {cat3}')
print(cat1)
