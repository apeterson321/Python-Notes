'''List Membership'''

# The in keyword can by used to check whether a specific object or element is in a list
  # The result returns a boolean value

operating_systems = ['Windows', 'Linux', 'MacOS', 'Android']

# Prints False

# The not in combination works, as you woud imagine, in the exact opposite way that in works; if an element is not in a list then <element> not in <list_name> will return True
