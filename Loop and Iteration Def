'''Iteration'''

# Iteration is the process of going through each item in a list, or any other object, and repeatedly executing the same code

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

i = 0
print(nums[i])
i +=1
print(nums[i])
i +=1
print(nums[i])
i +=1
print(nums[i])
i +=1
print(nums[i])
i +=1
print(nums[i])
i +=1
print(nums[i])
i +=1
print(nums[i])
i +=1
print(nums[i])
i +=1
print(nums[i])


'''Loops'''

# Loops are used to perform repeated operations. Repeated operations are often used to solve numeric problems. 

# There are 2 types of loops:
# - For Loop: when you know how many times you'll need to iterate through something
# - While Loop: when the number of iterations needed to solve a problem is unknown
