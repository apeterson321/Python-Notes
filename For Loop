'''For Loops'''

# for loops automatically go through each item in a list and perform operations in the indented block of code below the for statement, on each item, until there are no more items left in the list
for i in range(1, 11):
  print(i) #this for loop goes through numbers 1 through 10 (non-inclusive) and prints each number

# The first line of the for loop tells Python to go through the specified integers and declare the variable i with each sequential integer in each iteration. The : is needed at the end of the for statement to declare the start of the indented block of code.

'''The 4 Patterns of For Loops

for i in range(low, high):
    print(i)

for i in range(len(lst)):
    print(lst[i])

for element in lst:
    print(element)

for i, element in enumerate(lst):
    print(i)
