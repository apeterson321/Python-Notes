'''Accumulators'''

# ways to store values as they are iterated through a loop 

sum_accum = 0   # this is the accumulator to accumulate the sum values
list_ex = list(range(4,101,4))
for idx, num in enumerate(list_ex):
  temp = sum_accum

print('     The final sum is = ', sum_accum)

# this code takes a list of numbers and adds them together. The values are stored in the variable sum_accum (the accumulator)
