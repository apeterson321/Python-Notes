'''Break, Continue, Pass'''


'''Break'''

# the break command allows you to "break out" of a for or while loop that may run on for infinity otherwise

# this for loop will exit after 50
for num in range(50):
    print(num)
    if num == 25:
        break

# this for loop will exit once it's discovered that a number is prime
def is_prime(n):
    if n == 1:
        return False

        return True

    prime = True

        if n % i == 0:
            prime = False
            break
    return prime
print( )

'''Continue'''

# this command skips over any following lines of code and begins to reloop through the for / while loop 

# this function takes the sum of any even numbers within a list and skips over the odd numbers
def sum_only_evens(num_list):

    sum_ = 0
    for num in num_list:
        if num % 2 == 0:

          continue
    return sum_

num_list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
print(sum_only_evens(num_list))
print( )

'''Pass'''

# this command passes over a function and does not execute any code within the function (it passes over the function)

# none of these functions, nor the code within the functions, will execute
