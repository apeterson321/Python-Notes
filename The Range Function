'''Range Function'''

start = 0 #an integer number specifying at which position to start. Default is 0. Inclusive
stop = 10 #an integer number specifying at which position to end. Non-inclusive.
step = 2 #an integer number specifying the incrementation. Default is 1.

# Prints the numbers 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 each on a new line
for num in range(start, stop, step):
    print(num)

# If only one number is in the range function, it         defaults to the stop position
  # If two numbers are in the range function, defaults to the start and stop positions

# Creates a list from 3 to 9, incrementing by 1
list_1 = list(range(3, 10))

# Prints a list from 3 to 9, incrementing by 1
print(list_1)

# Can also create a list of negative numbers
list_3 = list(range(-10, 0))
print(list_3)

list_4 = list(range(-100, 101, 10))
print(list_4)
