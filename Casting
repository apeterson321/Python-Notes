#  Casting
# taking one data type and turning it into another data type
  # think of casting a person to perform as a different character in a movie
  # transforming the data type
print(25) #this is an integer
print(float(25)) #converts to a float
print(type(float(25))) #confirms type as float

print(18.63) #this is a float
print(int(18.6)) #converts to an integer (removes decimals)
print(type(int(18.63))) #confirms type as integer

#can also convert to a boolean Value
# has value = true; no value = false
print(bool(21))
print(type(bool(21)))
print(bool(0))
print(type(bool(0)))
