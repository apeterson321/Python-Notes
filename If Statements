# if statement include some condition, generally with a comparison operator (>, <, ==, etc.) that generates a True or False statement
  # if statement is true, the code will run; if false, the code will not run

some_var = 5

# checks if some_var is less than the integer 10
if some_var < 10:
    print("some_var is less than 10")

# checks if some_var is equal to the integer 5
if some_var == 5:
    print("some_var is equal to 5")

# checks if the integer 3 is greater than some_var
if 3 > some_var:
    print("3 is greater than some_var")
