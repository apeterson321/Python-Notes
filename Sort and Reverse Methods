'''Sort and Reverse Methods'''

# .sort() will sort some_list, in place, in ascending order. This performs the same activity as the sorted() function
numbers = [3, 2, 1, 6, 4]
numbers.sort()
print(numbers)
print( )

# .reverse() will reverse the order of some_list, in place. This performs the same activity as the reversed() function
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.reverse()
print(numbers)
print( )

'''Methods vs Functions'''

# methods modify lists in place while functions do not
nums_list = [9, 7, 8, 3, 5, 1, 2]
sorted(nums_list)
print(nums_list) # the list wasn't modified in place, so this will print the original list, since it wasn't modified
nums_list.sort()
print(nums_list)
