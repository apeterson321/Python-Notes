'''Mutability and Modifying'''

# Create a list
some_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Show the list and the id()
print(some_list)
print(id(some_list))

# Modify the list
some_list[1] = 'hot dog'
some_list[2] = ['dog', 'cat', None]

# Verify that the list has changed but the id() has not
print(some_list)
print(id(some_list))
print( ) #the ID of a list as an object is tied to the list itself and is not determined by the contents of that list

# Create two identical lists
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
list2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Show the id()s of list1
print(list1)
print(id(list1))
# Show the id()s of list2
print(list2)
print(id(list2))
print( )
# notice how both of these lists have the same value but have 2 different IDs

# changing the contents of a list does not change the ID of that list
list3 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print (list3)
print(id(list3))
list3[4] = "changed"
print(list3)
print(id(list3))
