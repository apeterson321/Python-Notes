# Simple Variable Assignment

x = 'some string'
print(x)
print(type(x))

y = 7
print(y)
print(type(y))

# Simple Incrementation

x = 10 #we assign 10 to x
x*=3 #reassignment saying new value of x is x*3
# can also be said that we incremented this variable by times 3
print(x)

y = 20
y = y % 8 #the syntax above can also be implemented like this; however, it's more common to see the above format
print(y)

# When Scalar Type Variables Change

x = 10
print(id(10)) #the number generated is the ID of x
x += 3 #we're changing the value of x so the ID of new x changes
print(id(x))

x = 11
y = 11
print('x: ',id(x))
print('y: ',id(y))
# since both x and y have the same value, the ID associated with the values are the same
