"""Logical Operators"""


'''Comparision Operators'''

# < and > : less than and greater than
# <= and >= : less than or equal to; greater than or  equal type 
# == : equality operator (is a = b ?)
# != : inequality operator (is a not = to b?)
# the result of all these comparison operators is either True or Flase
print(8 > 3 and 7 < 2)
print(1 == 1 and 3 >= 2)
print( )

'''Logical Operators'''

# and : statements on both sides of and need to be true for the whole statement to be True
print(5 == 5 and 6 > 4) #True
print(7 >= 5 and 5 != 5) #False
print( )

# or : only one of two statements on wither side must be true for the whole statement to be true
print(5 == 6 or 9 <= 9) #True
print(5 != 5 or 8 > 9) #False 
print( )

# not : negates what comes after it 
learning = True
print(not learning)
print( )

'''Bitwise Operators'''

# &: Bitwise and
print(5 == 5 & 6 > 4)
# |: Bitwise or
print(5 == 6 | 9 <= 9)
# ~: Bitwise not
print(~ learning)
