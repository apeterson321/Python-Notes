'''
* Understand the difference between global and local variables
* Change the value of a global variable from within a function

KEY LESSON: Variables within functions can only be accessed from within that function
  - However, variables that exist outside of functions can be called into it.
  - Scope is global vs local (within the function)

def add_2(x):
    return x+2


# this is fine
add_2(1)

# but this will throw an error!
# Comment the print(x) statement out (prepend with #)
# print(x)



# this should work
x=2
def add_2():
    return x+2

print(add_2())
print( )

# using the global function, you can call a global variable into the local function
# generally try to avoid this since it can cause a lot of mess
x = 2

def add_n(n):
    global x # telling the add_n function to look for `x` in the global scope
    x += n
    return x

print(add_n(2))
print(x)
