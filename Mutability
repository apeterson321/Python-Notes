* Understand the concept of mutability and how it relates to variables.
* Describe how variables are stored in Python

# Let's look at the ID of the value 4.0
x = 4.0
print(type(x))
print(id(x))
print()

# Cast x to an integer, notice how its ID changes
x = int(x)
print(type(x))
print(id(x))

# Let's throw in some more 'representations' of the integer value 4
a = int(16**0.5) # square root of 16, casted to the int type
b = 8//2 # integer division
c = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
d = 2**2 # 2 squared

# Look at the ID! All four variables--a, b, c, and d--all point to the same ID
print(id(a))
print(id(b))
print(id(c))
print(id(d))
print()
