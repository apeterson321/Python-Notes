'''Floor Division'''

# Floor division is the mathemtaical operator for dividing 2 numbers and rounding the quotient down to the nearest whole number
print(8//3)
print(8.0//3) #the data type of the result will default to a float if on of the numbers is a float
print(4//5)
print(4.3//5.1)
print( )

# Same can be applied for negative numbers; HOWEVER, floor division always rounds down to the nearest whole number, so the following results are -1 and -2
print(-2//5)
print(-4//3)
print( )

# The type() function will round UP to the nearest whole number while floor division rounds down; notice the difference below:
print(-2//5)
print(int(-2/5))
